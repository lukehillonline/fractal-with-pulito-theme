The size of a Textfield is flexible and depends on the component is it used in or the viewport it is displayed.

They may have a label which uses the same text style as a H5 heading and are required by default unless the label states they are optional.

Text fields requiring certain data formats such as numbers, e-mail addresses or passwords are declared accordingly. This makes it easier for the user to enter information using a virtual keyboard.
