The modal component is used to show additional or supporting content related to a particular user journey or section of content. The modal component can also be used to take the user on a focused user journey.

The modal component takes a series of configuration settings allowing it to have different controls, allowing you to hide / show the close button and the tap/drag/flick features.

##### Touch features
When on a touch device and the draggable setting is enabled, the modal becomes interactive with touch. This allows users to open and close the modal with different interactions. There are three available touch interactions tap, drag and flick. We define each one by the type of movement, taps have a maximum allowed movement, drags and a minimum allowed movement and flicks have a minimum velocity. The settings behind this can be seen in the code snippets below.
