The flexible grid consists of 12 columns and can be nested. 

We use a mobile-first approach which means the spacing (gutter width) between the columns is fixed within its breakpoint starting from Mobile (320px) up to desktop (1440px).

The grid has a fixed margin on either side  to allow white space at all times.
