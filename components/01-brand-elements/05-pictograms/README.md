In our Pictogram Library there is a wide range of pictograms available for UI purposes.  
  
All pictograms should all work in proportion to one another and the context they are used in.  
  
##### Implementation  

These icons all come from an icon sprite that is lazyloaded through JavaScript, this script runs on page load. The individual icons in the icon sprite can use accessed with the `<use>` element link in the examples below.
