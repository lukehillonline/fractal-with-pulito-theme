We want people to see our logo clearly. To make sure itâ€™s visible, we have minimum sizes for print and digital. When you place our logo in a design, make sure you give it room to breathe. We call this clear-space.  Always leave a clear-space equal to half the width of the logo on all sides.

Our logo is the mark of reassurance at the heart of our brand identity. Always use the correct master artwork files and never change, distort or add anything to our logo.

The secondary version of our logo is white and only used on blue backgrounds or dark images.
