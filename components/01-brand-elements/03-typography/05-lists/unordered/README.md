Lists can be used to list content related to a certain subject. They usually are used within an informational context, combined with paragraphs. 

You can use an unordered list (ul) or ordered/numbered list (ol).

If changing the order of the items makes the list incorrect, you want to use ordered list. If the order doesn't matter, use an unordered list.
