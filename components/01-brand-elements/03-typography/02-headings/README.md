Headings can be used as titles to paragraphs or standalone components. They help us to create information hierarchy and help to guide users through our screens.

Although we often differentiate headings by size they are about relative importance of information.
We have six levels of headings you can use to structure sections of content on the page (`<h1>` through to `<h6>`).
